# simple-image-ocr
Simple browser OCR with minimal internet required. Paste from clipboard, drag/drop, browse file system, or input multiple URLs.

Tesseract.js does require internet to retrieve training data and worker js but it does not send submitted
images anywhere, all OCR processing is done locally in the browser.
